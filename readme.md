# Civilian Pilot Tanoa #

A semi realisitc simulation of an every day civilian air pilot flying passengers to and fro, across the island of Tanoa.

Arrive at the airport. Reach your aircraft. Refuel if needed. Taxi to the departures area. Greet your passengers. Plan your route. Take off. Arrive. Taxi to Arrivals. Engine Off. Instruct your passengers

Features:

* Simulated air traffic - Computer controlled/AI pilots that fly around at random and land at most airports.
* ATIS (automated airport time and weather information) at each airport. Tune in before you take off or land to hear current runway information and airport conditions.
* Landing training aids at each airport (turn them on or off at info stands).
* A selection of aircraft including the Caeser BTT and several helicopters. Passengers will board the last aircraft you enter.

Customizable features:

* Use the info stands (silver standing platforms) at each airport to change options.
* Turn off task markers for enhanced realism. You'll be forced to navigate to the airport by sight or even using your map.
* Easily customize the Weather (Clear, Cloudy, Rainy).
* Easily change Time of Day. Fly at night - most airports are properly lit!

-----

Future considerations:

* ATIS - a semi dynamic automated information system that will relay date/time, weather and runway information for each airport
* Taxi instructions - tasks with details on how and where to taxi
* Custom Radio Freqs - if we integrate with TFR we can require that users check in with tower and ground on correct frequencies
* Random radio chatter
* Random air traffic
* Random ground traffic
* Regional controllers (keep you in correct altitude and away from hazards)
* Scrambling jets in the restricted airspace
