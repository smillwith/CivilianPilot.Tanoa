# Civilian Pilot Tanoa #

A semi realisitc simulation of an every day civilian air pilot flying passengers to and fro, across the island of Tanoa.

Arrive at the airport. Reach your aircraft. Refuel if needed. Taxi to the departures area. Greet your passengers. Plan your route. Take off. Arrive. Taxi to Arrivals. Engine Off. Instruct your passengers


TODO: 

1. Add 'action' handler to the passengers which will have them enter the plane
2. Add the arrived trigger
3. Add refuel services via action menu
4. Add repair services via action menu
5. Add the "disembark" action for pilot when passengers are inside


How do I know when the vehicle is moving? How do I know when it's on the ground?

Notes:

What are the different states?

* Flying?
* Boarding
* In plane?
* Has passengers?

Nothing - Taxiing - Nothing
Boarding - Transporting
Flying
Disembarking - Nothing
